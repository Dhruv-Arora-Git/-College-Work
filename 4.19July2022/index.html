      Kṛṣṇa—this sound is transcendental. Kṛṣṇa means the highest pleasure. All
      of us, every living being, seeks pleasure. But we do not know how to seek
      pleasure perfectly. With a materialistic concept of life, we are
      frustrated at every step in satisfying our pleasure because we have no
      information regarding the real level on which to have real pleasure. For
      the last few weeks we have been learning that we are not this body; we are
      consciousness. Not exactly consciousness, for consciousness is actually
      the symptom of our real identity: we are pure soul, now merged within this
      material body. Modern material science lays no stress on this; therefore
      the scientists are sometimes misled in their understanding of spirit soul.
      But spirit soul is a fact, which anyone can understand by the presence of
      consciousness. Any child can understand that consciousness is the symptom
      of the spirit soul. Now the whole process we are trying to learn from the
      Bhagavad-gītā (The Song of God) is how to bring ourselves to this level of
      consciousness. And if we act from the level of consciousness, then we may
      not be pushed again into the level of this bodily conception; and, if we
      can continue on that level, if we can continue to act in pure
      consciousness, then, at the end of this body we shall be free from
      material contamination, our spiritual life will be revived, and the
      ultimate result will be that in our next life, after leaving this body, we
      shall have our full, eternal spiritual life. Spirit, as we have already
      discussed, is described as eternal. Even after the destruction of this
      body, consciousness is not destroyed. Rather, consciousness is transferred
      to another type of body and again makes us aware of the material
      conception of life. That is also described in the Bhagavad-gītā. At the
      time of death, if our consciousness is pure, we can be sure that our next
      life will not be material—our next life will be spiritual. If our
      consciousness is not pure at the point of death, then, after leaving this
      body, we shall have to take another material body. That is the process
      which is going on. That is Nature's law.
